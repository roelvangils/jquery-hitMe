# hitMe jQuery plugin

(TODO: Explain what it's good for.)

## Use

By default, the plugin will apply to the first link element in the container. Optionally, the plugin accepts a CSS or jQuery selector as its only parameter.

This selector should point to a single link that's inside of the element(s) that you apply this plugin on.

- `h2 > a`
- `.more`
